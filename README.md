# Firebase Crash Reporting Demo

This app is a demo of Firebase Crash Reporting, for a talk given at the
[Google LaunchPad Build SSA, Lagos](https://events.withgoogle.com/launchpad-build-ssa/nigeria-lagos/)

There are 2 branches:
  1.  **[Master](https://github.com/segunfamisa/firebase-crash-demo/tree/master)**: Which contains
  the incomplete source code (without Firebase).
  2.  **[Completed](https://github.com/segunfamisa/firebase-crash-demo/tree/completed)**: Which contains
  the completed source code, with Firebase setup and crash reporting added.


#### Running the completed project
  1. Checkout the [completed](https://github.com/segunfamisa/firebase-crash-demo/tree/completed) branch.
  2. Log on to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create or import a new project.
  3. Enable Firebase Crash reporting and download the `google-services.json` file from the console
  and add it to the app-module root. `<app-module>/google-services.json`
